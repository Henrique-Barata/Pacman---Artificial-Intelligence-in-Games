# Pacman---Artificial-Intelligence-in-Games
This project uses a decision tree and A* algorithm with Manhattan distance to navigate Pacman. The AI makes Pacman chase ghosts when a power pellet is active or flee otherwise. If no ghosts are near, Pacman targets the nearest pellet or fruit. While the decision tree works well, bugs in pellet pursuit and ghost evasion prevent level completion.
