Pacman - Artificial Intelligence in Games

This project uses a decision tree and A* algorithm with Manhattan distance to navigate Pacman. The AI makes Pacman chase ghosts when a power pellet is active or flee otherwise. If no ghosts are near, Pacman targets the nearest pellet or fruit. While the decision tree works well, bugs in pellet pursuit and ghost evasion prevent level completion.
Features

    Decision tree for AI decision-making.
    A* algorithm with Manhattan distance for pathfinding.
    AI behavior: chase ghosts with power pellet, flee from ghosts without power pellet, target nearest pellet or fruit.
